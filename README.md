# 🏦 Loan Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a supervised machine learning application that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not based on historical applicant data. The goal is to automate and improve loan approval processes using data-driven insights.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains information on loan applicants, including:

- Gender
- Marital Status
- Education
- Applicant Income
- Loan Amount
- Credit History
- Self Employment Status
- Property Area
- Loan Status (Target)

> Note: The dataset used in this project is commonly available from sources like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or internal repositories.
